                        "3. **Choose healthy fats**: Include foods like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, as they are calorie-rich and provide healthy fats.\n\n" +
                        "4. **Protein-rich foods**: Incorporate lean meats, fish, eggs, and plant-based proteins like beans, lentils, and tofu to build muscle mass.\n\n" +
                        "5. **Frequent meals**: Eat smaller meals every 3â€“4 hours to boost calorie intake throughout the day.\n\n" +
                        "6. **Smoothies and shakes**: Consider drinking high-calorie smoothies and shakes made with ingredients like yogurt, fruits, and protein powder.\n\n" +
                        "7. **Avoid empty calories**: While increasing calorie intake, avoid excessive consumption of junk food that offers little nutritional value.\n\n" +
                        "8. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated, but avoid excessive amounts of caffeinated drinks as they can suppress appetite.\n\n" +
                        "9. **Include dairy products**: Dairy like milk, cheese, and yogurt provides important nutrients and can contribute to your daily calorie intake.\n\n" +
                        "10. **Get enough sleep**: Rest is crucial for overall health, and ensuring good sleep helps with weight gain as it improves appetite regulation.\n";
